Go Slice - is like vector<int> arr in C++ , the major difference is that it can append or can be executed dynamically ,mtlb isme aur values ko add kar sakte hai without tension of Capacity of an array , it can shrink accordingly 



Slice -
var a []int = []int {1,2,3}
var b []int = append(a,5)   o/p - [1 2 3 5]
var c []int = append(b,a...) o/p- [1 2 3 5 1 2 3]  


Make function -
ex-  var i []int  = make([string] int)


Concurrency - Is same as in Java
